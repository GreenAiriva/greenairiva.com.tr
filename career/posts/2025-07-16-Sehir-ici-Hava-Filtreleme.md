## The Urban Air Crisis

While cities represent one of humanity’s greatest engineering achievements, today they face severe environmental crises. Population density, the rise in motor vehicle usage, industrial activities, and the urban heat island effect caused by dense construction all contribute to both polluting and warming the urban atmosphere. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change is expected to cause approximately [250,000 additional deaths per year](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/public-health-and-environment) between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress alone. By 2030, the direct health costs are projected to range between \$2–4 billion USD annually. Urban air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, black carbon, and greenhouse gases threaten not only human health but also the global climate balance.

This reality points to a problem far too complex to be resolved by emission source control alone. That’s why “active air purification technologies” have been gaining increased attention in recent years. These technologies aim not only to monitor polluted air but also to purify it—and in some cases, to permanently remove certain gases. Moreover, some solutions integrate with art, architecture, and biotechnology, contributing to urban aesthetics as well. The three primary technology domains currently in focus are:

* Biological filters and Moss-based systems
* Electrostatic ionization towers
* Direct air capture and carbon storage technologies

While each of these systems offers unique advantages, they also come with important limitations and controversies. Urban planning for the future must strike a balance—avoiding overreliance on these technologies, yet not overlooking their potential.

## Biologically-Based Approaches: Moss Filter Technologies

When it comes to urban air purification, one of the most aesthetically pleasing solutions is undoubtedly **biological filter systems**. In particular, Moss-based wall panels or vertical urban furniture are striking examples that blend natural biological processes with technology.

### How Do Moss Walls Work?

These systems place several selected species of microalgal Moss onto specialized vertical panels or mats. Air is drawn through these Moss-covered surfaces using integrated fan systems. Pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, or black carbon adhere to the microscopic surfaces of the Moss structures. Additionally, the Moss perform photosynthesis—consuming limited amounts of CO₂ and producing oxygen.

One of the most recent implementations is a **vertical Moss filter system** developed by a Europe-based company. The company’s products combine biological filtration, IoT-based monitoring, and energy efficiency. The Moss not only filter pollutants but also reduce ambient heat through evaporative cooling from their surfaces. Measurements have shown that these systems can provide localized cooling of up to 4 °C.

### Performance and Limitations

Tests have shown that these biological filters can reach an air purification capacity of approximately 4,400 to 5,000 m³ per hour. Their particulate matter (PM) filtration efficiency can exceed 80%. However, the system's performance depends on several key variables:

* **Wind Impact:** Outdoor air dynamics can reduce filtration efficiency.
* **Humidity and Irrigation Needs:** Regular water supply is required to keep the Moss alive.
* **CO₂ Capture Limitation:** The amount of CO₂ absorbed by the Moss is relatively low. On average, one Moss wall can capture about 342 kg of CO₂ per year—a limited figure compared to urban CO₂ emissions.
* **Cost:** Installation, maintenance, and irrigation costs are significantly high and cannot be overlooked.

Nevertheless, in terms of urban aesthetics, air quality, and climate comfort, these systems are regarded as an important tool at the local scale. They have started to spread across public squares, bus stops, and building façades in various cities across Europe and Asia.

## Electrostatic-Based Approaches: Ionization Towers

Another innovative approach in air purification technology is the use of **positive ionization-based towers**. One of the most widely recognized examples is the 7-meter-tall tower prototype developed by Dutch artist and designer Daan Roosegaarde. The design serves not only as a technological solution but also as an art installation aimed at raising environmental awareness.

<img src="../assets/img/blog/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme-SFT.jpg" alt= "SFT">

*[(Studio Roosegaarde)](https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/smog-free-tower)*


### How Does Ionization Work?

The system generates an electrical field to produce positive ions. Particulate matter in the air becomes charged by these ions and is then attracted to negatively charged plates, where it is captured and held within the system. As a result, “cleaned air” is released back into the environment.

The measured air flow rate of the tower is approximately 30,000 m³ per day. Its energy consumption is notably low—comparable to that of an electric kettle. According to research conducted by Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, the tower can reduce PM10 particles by 45% and PM2.5 by 25% within a 20-meter radius. Some tests have even reported up to 70% effectiveness for PM10 at closer distances.

### Limitations and Debates

Electrostatic ionization systems have a **primarily localized effect**. Even within a 50-meter radius, their effectiveness can drop to around 30%, and at 500 meters, it may decline to as low as 10%. In other words, achieving comprehensive air purification at the city scale would require the installation of hundreds of towers—posing significant challenges in terms of cost and space.

Additionally, these towers:

* **Do not capture gaseous pollutants.** They only target particulate matter.
* **Raise questions about their energy source.** Their net benefit remains positive as long as renewable energy is used; however, if powered by fossil fuels, their climate impact becomes limited.
* **Require proper disposal of waste collected on the plates**, which necessitates a separate environmental management process.

An interesting feature of this system is the processing of collected particulates into carbon-based jewelry. This approach presents an innovative social model in terms of both economic sustainability and environmental awareness. However, in terms of genuine climate benefits, the impact remains largely local and does not scale beyond that.

## Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Storage Approaches

One of the most striking technologies in the field of active air purification is **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**. DAC is designed to capture CO₂ directly from the atmosphere, with the goal of either utilizing it or permanently storing it underground. This technology stands out not only at the urban scale but also as a critical tool for achieving global climate targets.

<img src="../assets/img/blog/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme-DAC.jpg" alt= "DAC">

*[(Carbon Direct)](https://www.carbon-direct.com/insights/direct-air-capture-is-ready-for-its-close-up)*


### How Does DAC Work?

DAC systems draw in ambient air using modular units and bind the CO₂ in the air to chemical adsorbents. These adsorbents are then heated to release and purify the captured CO₂. The resulting CO₂ can be managed in two main ways:

1. **Industrial Use:** For applications in the food industry (e.g., carbonated beverages) or greenhouse gas applications.
2. **Permanent Storage (S):** The CO₂ is injected into geological formations such as basalt rock. There, it undergoes chemical reactions, turning into carbonate minerals and remaining isolated from the atmosphere for millions of years.

Pilot projects conducted in Iceland have proven that this “mineralization” process is practically feasible.

However, one critical issue must not be overlooked: Every ecosystem has its own unique balance.
When the atmosphere is exposed to pollutants beyond its natural limits, this balance is disrupted. In addition to the climate crisis we are currently experiencing, catastrophic environmental issues like [Ocean Acidification](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html) stem from such disruptions. For example, when trees in a specific terrestrial ecosystem are cleared to make way for farmland, the integrity of that habitat is compromised—leading to serious environmental problems such as erosion, reduced soil fertility, and loss of biodiversity.

Similarly, the removal of carbon dioxide—one of the primary atmospheric pollutants—from one environment and its injection into underground geological formations has the potential to disrupt the dynamics of subsurface ecosystems and may introduce new environmental risks. Therefore, technologies used to combat climate change must be evaluated not only in terms of their effectiveness in removing pollutants from the atmosphere, but also in terms of their secondary and long-term impacts on ecosystems.


### Current DAC Applications

One of the pioneering companies in this field was founded in Switzerland in 2009. The company operates with modules roughly the size of a small hair dryer. Its initial facilities gained recognition through the Hinwil (Switzerland) and Orca (Iceland) projects. The Orca plant, in particular, was theoretically designed to capture 4,000 tons of CO₂ per year. However, in practice, the amount captured remained between 600–1,000 tons annually.

The newly completed Mammoth facility marks a significant milestone in scaling up the DAC sector, with a planned capacity of 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year. In the United States, facilities with a capacity of 1 million tons per year are being planned in states such as Louisiana and North Dakota.

### Energy and Cost Barriers

The greatest disadvantage of DAC systems is their **tremendous energy demand**. With current technologies:

* Approximately 500 kWh of electricity
* And around 1,500 kWh of heat energy are required per ton of CO₂ captured.

As a result, if DAC facilities are not powered by renewable energy, they may not even be able to offset their own carbon footprint. Additionally, DAC remains very expensive in terms of cost. Today, the cost of capturing one ton of CO₂ is around \$1,000 USD. Targets are set at approximately \$300 by 2030 and \$100 by 2050, but whether these targets will be achieved remains uncertain.

On the other hand, many technology firms anticipate that this cost will decrease over time, supported by the carbon market, government incentives, and carbon credits. For example, Microsoft, Stripe, and some insurance companies are backing this process by purchasing large volumes of carbon credits.


### DAC’s Role in the Context of Urban Air

DAC technology differs significantly from in-city air purification devices. DAC facilities are typically built in rural areas or industrial zones because they require high-volume air intake and large operational space. Moreover, urban air circulation patterns and the risk of pollutant re-diffusion make DAC installations inefficient within city environments. Therefore, DAC is **not a direct solution** for improving urban air quality. However, it stands out as an **indispensable tool** for reducing atmospheric CO₂ stocks on a global scale.

## Which Is More Effective? – When the Three Urban Air Technologies Converge

The three active air purification approaches outlined above differ significantly in scale, technology, and objectives:

* **Biological Moss Systems** → Reduce PM and NOx locally, provide aesthetic value, and offer cooling effects. However, they have limited gas capture capacity and high maintenance costs.
* **Electrostatic Towers** → Effective for local PM reduction and have low energy consumption. However, they cannot remove gaseous pollutants and have a very narrow range of effectiveness.
* **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** → Targets CO₂ exclusively and is critical for global climate efforts. However, it does not clean urban air directly and still faces challenges in energy demand and cost.

## Let’s Not Miss the Big Picture!

Cleaning urban air is not just an engineering challenge—it is also a social, economic, and political issue. Each of the current technologies offers valuable solutions for humanity. However, it is crucial that city administrations and policymakers use these technologies **appropriately and proportionally**.

The fate of cities should not be tied solely to the success of active air purification technologies. The most effective solution remains **reducing emissions at the source.** Nevertheless, biological filters, ionization towers, and direct air capture facilities will continue to serve as critical tools in the pursuit of clean air and climate goals.

The coming decades will determine how these technologies are balanced—not just through engineering, but across the realms of economics, society, and the environment. Only by striking the right balance can cities move toward a cleaner and more livable future.

# **GreenAiriva: An Innovative Approach Making a Difference in Urban Air Purification**

## Urban Air and the Deadlock of Intractability

Urban air pollution is perhaps the heaviest price paid for the great human achievement of urbanization. Rising populations, transportation, industry, and energy consumption have transformed the urban atmosphere into an almost invisible enemy. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), greenhouse gases (CO₂, N₂O, CH₄), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and fluorinated gases pose threats to both public health and the climate.

In recent years, many different technologies have attempted to tackle this issue. Systems such as biological Moss filters, electrostatic ionization towers, and direct air capture (DAC) plants have made important strides. However, each has encountered some critical limitations:

* Moss filters → Effective only on a local scale, with limited impact on gas emissions.
* Ionization towers → Cannot capture gaseous pollutants; target only particulate matter.
* DAC → Captures only CO₂, requires massive facilities and very high energy and cost. Its environmental impacts remain uncertain!

This is precisely where GreenAiriva introduces a more **comprehensive**, **modular**, and **intelligent** approach to urban air purification.

## What Makes GreenAiriva Unique?


<img src="../assets/img/blog/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme/2025-07-16-Sehir-ici-Hava-Filtreleme-Greenairiva.png" alt= "GreenAiriva">



GreenAiriva is an **active air purification** technology designed to combat urban air pollution by targeting **multiple pollutants**, operating with real-time data, and prioritizing energy efficiency. The project goes beyond traditional air filtration by aiming to **intervene as close as possible to the source of pollution** at the urban scale.

Key distinguishing features include:

* **Multi-Layer Adsorbent Technology**
* **Real-Time Data Analytics**
* **Autonomous Operation Powered by Solar Energy**
* **Modular and Scalable System Design**

## Problem 1 – Capturing Not Only Particulate Matter but Also Gaseous Pollutants

### The Shortcomings of Existing Solutions

* Moss systems and ionization towers primarily capture particulate matter (PM).
* DAC focuses exclusively on CO₂.

However, urban air is a much more complex mixture. In addition to CO₂, pollutants such as CH₄, N₂O, NOx, and F-gases are also released into the atmosphere. According to NOAA and EPA data, major greenhouse gases and F-gases have shown a dramatic upward trend over the past century. The current overemphasis on particulate matter and carbon dioxide in existing technologies renders many of them insufficient in addressing the **multi-pollutant nature** of urban air.


### GreenAiriva’s Solution

GreenAiriva utilizes **multi-layer adsorbent systems**, with each layer composed of a material specifically selected for a particular gas. This selective separation method allows pollutants to be both captured and isolated within the device. As a result, GreenAiriva can **target multiple pollutants in a single unit**, making it a groundbreaking solution for areas with complex urban air pollution profiles.

The use of adsorbent materials with low desorption temperatures also enables **cost-effective pollutant recovery**, enhancing both environmental and economic sustainability.

---

## Problem 2 – Energy Dependence and Sustainability

### The Shortcomings of Existing Solutions

While many current technologies are capable of generating some of their own energy, this is not always feasible—particularly for large-scale operations. Relying on renewable sources for such systems can become costly and introduce operational and maintenance challenges.

* DAC → Requires up to 2,000 kWh per ton of CO₂ captured.
* Moss systems → Constant electricity consumption for pumps and irrigation.
* Ionization towers → Although individual units consume little electricity, large-scale deployment can create a substantial energy burden on the grid.

### GreenAiriva’s Solution

GreenAiriva operates using **solar-assisted energy**.

* It is equipped with high-efficiency photovoltaic panels that power its motors and sensors.
* During winter months, when energy input is reduced, the device optimizes its operational cycle to lower consumption.
* Even with environmental efficiency losses (due to dust, clouds, rain, snow, etc.), the PV panels can still provide sufficient energy for 9–10 months of full-performance operation annually.

For example:

> At the 40° latitude in Turkey, with an 18 m² panel surface and accounting for a 60% efficiency loss, an average of 5 kWh/day of energy can still be supplied via solar power throughout the year. As a result, GreenAiriva is one of the rare air purification systems capable of operating **off-grid**.


---

## Problem 3 – Limited Local Impact

### The Shortcomings of Existing Solutions

* Ionization towers → Effective within only a 20–30 meter radius.
* DAC facilities → Operate far from urban centers and do not directly affect city air quality.

### GreenAiriva’s Solution

GreenAiriva features an **air processing capacity of 600 m³/hour**. Its low-flow fans not only reduce energy consumption but also minimize urban noise pollution, operating at just **37 dB**.

This allows a single device to capture at least:

* 5 tons of CO₂e
* 200 kg of PM10
* 160 kg of PM2.5
* 7.4 kg of methane
* 3.17 kg of N₂O

annually. Since field testing has not yet been conducted, these figures are based on average atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Data sources include the EPA, NOAA, TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute), and UHKAİ (National Air Quality Monitoring Network).

Real-world performance is expected to be even higher. GreenAiriva installations will be prioritized in areas with **elevated concentrations of major greenhouse gases**, offering significant benefits in high-traffic zones, industrial areas, and densely populated urban districts.


---

## Problem 4 – Lack of Permanent Storage

### The Shortcomings of Existing Solutions

* Moss systems → Convert gases into biomass but do not offer permanent storage.
* Ionization towers → Mechanically capture PM; storage is not a concern.
* DAC → Permanently stores CO₂ by mineralizing it in basalt rock (carbonation).

### GreenAiriva’s Solution

GreenAiriva:

* **Captures gases on adsorbent surfaces.**
* Regenerates the adsorbents through a controlled desorption process.
* The recovered gases can be sold for industrial use (e.g., CO₂ for greenhouse applications) or for carbon credit trading.

What sets GreenAiriva apart in this process:

* It **does not perform CO₂ mineralization** like Climeworks; hence, it does not offer geological permanent storage.
* However, it **reduces emissions at or near the source** within the urban environment.

Bottom line:

> GreenAiriva adheres to the principle of “reduce at the source first.” Permanent storage is DAC’s job—but GreenAiriva cleans the air **in situ** at the city level.

---

## Additional Benefits: Health and Social Impact

Beyond its technological advantages, GreenAiriva offers significant social benefits:

* Direct contribution to urban health → potential reduction in respiratory illnesses.
* Increased public awareness regarding air quality.
* Provides scientific data to support urban planning.
* Contributes to sustainable urban development goals.

In particular, GreenAiriva serves as a valuable tool in alignment with the European Green Deal and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being, SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 13 – Climate Action).


---

## Conclusion: A Smarter Path for Cities

Urban air purification is no longer a problem that can be solved by simply installing filters. No system that fails to address the source of pollution can succeed in the long run. DAC technologies are crucial for the global climate, but they offer no direct benefit to city air.

While Moss panels and ionization towers are aesthetically pleasing and locally beneficial, they remain limited in tackling gaseous pollutants.

GreenAiriva sets a new standard in urban air purification through **multi-pollutant targeting**, **dynamic operation with real-time data**, **low energy consumption**, and **a modular design**. Of course, there are still challenges to overcome—especially the implementation of effective CO₂ adsorption, which remains a critical area of research.

But one thing is clear:

> To make our cities cleaner, healthier, and more livable, **integrated solutions like GreenAiriva** will be the key to the future.
