# **The Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and Its Importance for Turkey: A Detailed Analysis within the Framework of the EPA SC-GHG Report**

The climate crisis is a consequence of human-induced activities carried out since the Industrial Revolution. Throughout world history, various climate changes have occurred; however, none have shown an increase as rapid as the one we are currently experiencing. The effects of the climate crisis are felt in our daily lives through environmental changes such as rising temperatures, humidity imbalances, and extreme weather events. For example, temperatures deviating from seasonal norms, unusual snowfall, or extreme heatwaves during summer are reflections of this crisis in our everyday lives.

However, the truly devastating impact of the climate crisis lies in the adaptation challenges faced by ecosystems beyond weather conditions. Each species can survive only within specific environmental parameters. The climate-induced extinction of microorganisms—organisms that form the foundation of the food chain—disrupts the balance of entire ecosystems in a cascading manner. Just like the degradation occurring in terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems also face serious threats. The increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentration diffuses into aquatic environments, leading to [ocean acidification](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html) and triggering the formation of carbonic acid in water. This process causes a chain reaction of destruction to oceanic flora and fauna, thereby threatening the entire marine ecosystem.

## What Is Social Cost?

This is where the concept of "social cost" comes into play. Social cost refers to the present monetary value of the future economic and environmental damages caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The purpose of these calculations is to express the adverse effects of greenhouse gases in economic terms, providing policymakers with concrete data.

In 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a study titled [“Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases” (SC-GHG)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-12/epa_scghg_2023_report_final.pdf) to estimate the social cost of carbon emissions. This study expresses the monetary impacts of the three primary greenhouse gases identified by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol—CO₂ (carbon dioxide), CH₄ (methane), and N₂O (nitrous oxide)—on health, agriculture, the economy, and ecosystems. For these calculations, the EPA utilized the Ramsey Discount Rate methodology and made projections in ten-year intervals through the year 2080. The study was updated and republished in 2023.

## Importance and Content of the EPA SC-GHG Report

The EPA’s 2023 SC-GHG report is one of the most up-to-date and detailed studies on calculating the social cost of greenhouse gases. Methodologically, the report consists of four main modules:

1. **Socioeconomic and Emissions Module:** Uses scenarios (RFF-SPs) related to future population growth, economic development, and energy consumption to make projections.
2. **Climate Module:** Employs the FaIR model to calculate the concentration of gases in the atmosphere and their impact on temperature increase.
3. **Damage Module:** Assesses the damages caused by greenhouse gases across various sectors such as health, agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and ecosystems.
4. **Discounting Module:** Applies the Ramsey Discount Rate to calculate the present monetary value of future damages. Using a lower discount rate increases the present value of future damages.

The report also uses Monte Carlo simulations to measure the impact of uncertainties. These analyses help ensure the robustness and reliability of the results.


## Social Cost Calculation Example for Turkey

Since the EPA’s studies are largely focused on the U.S. and Canada, their direct application to Turkey is limited. However, this work can serve as a guide for Turkey to conduct its own calculations.

For example, let’s calculate the social cost based on land transportation emissions across Turkey:

As of 2024, the number of registered vehicles in traffic in Turkey is [29.95 million]() (You can review *Table-3: Number of motor land vehicles by years* on the linked page). According to TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute) data, 29% of cars use gasoline, 33% use diesel, 33% use LPG, and 0.03% are electric or hybrid. For other vehicle types, let’s use the average values from the IPCC Emission Factors table. We’ll assume that each vehicle travels an average of 10 km per day.

As a result of all these assumptions, we estimate that across Turkey, approximately 38.5 Mt of CO₂, 1,615.8 tons of CH₄, and 1,608.7 tons of N₂O are emitted into the atmosphere annually.

Now, let’s input these figures into the social cost table prepared by the EPA [(You can access the Excel spreadsheet here)](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/scghg).

When we apply these data to the EPA’s social cost calculation tool, the social cost of land transportation across Turkey is estimated at approximately \$14.013 billion USD. This figure clearly illustrates the economic damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions. So, why did we use the 1.5% discount rate?

## 1.5% Discount Rate (Low Discount Rate – High Future Value)

### When should it be preferred?

* In approaches that are more sensitive to the risks of climate change and that place greater emphasis on the future.

* When social justice and intergenerational responsibility are prioritized.

* This is the level recommended by the EU and some EPA documents.

### What does it mean?

* You place greater importance on future damages.

* The social cost of emissions appears significantly higher.

* **Use case:** Sustainability reports, activist publications, projects targeting high environmental standards.

## GreenAiriva’s Contributions to Reducing Social Cost

GreenAiriva offers innovative solutions aimed at reducing the social cost of greenhouse gases. Its developed adsorption technologies focus specifically on lowering atmospheric concentrations of CH₄, N₂O, and F-gases. This technology plays a vital role in reducing both the economic and environmental costs of the climate crisis, while also supporting economic sustainability. GreenAiriva’s solutions serve as examples for social cost accounting and provide globally applicable sustainability models.

Our theoretical calculations show that each GreenAiriva device—depending on its area of application—can provide a reduction of **\$321.8 USD per unit**. These figures are based on theoretical estimates derived from [average atmospheric gas concentrations shared by the EPA and NOAA](https://blog.greenairiva.com.tr/article.html?slug=2025-07-10-hava-kalitesi-greenairiva). In real-world scenarios, actual efficiency could be significantly higher.

Thanks to its contribution to social cost reduction and its ability to generate carbon credits, GreenAiriva can offset its own cost in a very short time. Compared to its competitors and other climate action measures, it offers significant advantages in terms of cost and feasibility.

Stay tuned for more developments. **Rise for a Cleaner Planet!**
